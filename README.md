Software design document

1.) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted me to design a cross-platform version of their game 'Draw It or Lose It', currently an Android-only game. The game needed to be a cross-platform, multiplayer event. The game needed to allow multiple clients from different platforms (desktop, mobile) to interact in a virtual team environment. The game needed to maintain teams, players, and scores, provide communication between players for the ability to make guesses, and record the game data (player accounts, scores, history, etc).



2.) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I explained the steps needed to make this design work for The Gaming Room in a thorough manner, but in a way those without technical expertise could understand.



3.) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I felt that it helped me to break the code into bite-sized pieces (instead of a mountain) and kept everyone on the same page. It also made the coding architecture more apparent, because I could see exactly what needed to be coded and in what way.



4.) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the Evaluation Table. It seems a bit to long, in my opinion--as if it could be more concise, and therefore shorter. I would revise what I wrote in the table's cells to make them more short and concise.



5.) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were cross-platform communication and latency. I implemented them by using cloud-based platform (that all would have access to) and by using a CDN to reduce latency.



6.) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached it by thinking of the requirements that the client, The Gaming Room, wanted and how I could combine that with what a user would want/need in using the client's program. From there, I researched/thought about the best way to combine both and began developing the design. I believe it is the way I will always approach designing any application. It takes the client's needs into account as well as what will make the application work well for the user--which will make the client's software more popular if the user's enjoy it.
